Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability, Statistics for machine learning
This repository is divided into the sections above that highlights my studies on math related to concepts that would help me understand machine learning and data science as a whole.

Linkedln learning and other resource are used for studies.
I learned some applications of the above topic in machine learning 

Linear Algebra:
  - Data (features/labels) are represent in vector form for computation in machine learning algorithm
  - Linear transformation used to perform multiple operations on data by condensing these operation into a transformation matrix
  - Diagonalisaion is a used for Principal Component Analysis which is important in dimensionality reduction
    
Calculus: 
  - used in gradient descent algorithm core algorithm of optmising a model
  - used in backpropagation which is a core aspect of neural networks
